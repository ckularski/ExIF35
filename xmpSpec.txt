The ExIf35 XMP Namespace
November 17, 2012
----------------------------

Abstract

The ExIf35 namespace is the XMP namespace used by ExIf5 and its digital still
camera counterpart, ExIfDSC. The namespace is primarily used to store values to
an image file that is from a film camera, where exif and existing XMP 
namespaces do not provide. 

Discussion

The namespace idenfier "ExIf35" was selected because it is not a generic term, 
and can not be easily confused with other namespaces (not even XMP exif, which 
uses lowercase "exif"). The namespace "Film" was considered briefly, but it was
decided that using that namespace would potentially conflict with other spaces,
since there is no mechanism for centrally registering XMP namespaces.
